# Storybook for Tailwind Blog

This is the component library for my Next.js Tailwind [blog & portfolio](https://duncanwhite.co.uk/) app.

It was set up as an example of using an [npm component library package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-blog-storybook) with Storybook, which is installed into the main project.

The npm package can be installed into any next.js application.

`npm i tailwind-blog-storybook`

or

`yarn add tailwind-blog-storybook`
